LuxRender Static Compilation Environment
========================================

This collection of scripts is intended for automatic creation of build
environment and Lux compilation with statically linked dependency libs.

Layout:
------
 - build
   The main routine.
   
 - build-{32,64}-*
   Wrapper scripts for compiling on the most common platforms.
   
 - distfiles
   Directory for the downloaded dependencies sources.
   
 - distfiles/files
   Dependencies manifest.
   
 - utils
   Directory with a number of helper scripts.

Requirements:
------------
Some dependencies aren't addressed by the script, and must be resolved
by the user prior to compilation. Among them are:
 - Python 3
 - OpenGL Graphics Library (MESA)
 - OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW)
 - OpenCL library and header files (if you need OpenCL support)

Running build script for the first time will download dependencies
sources into the distfiles dir, taking about 300 MB of disk space.
Complete environment requires additional 300 MB for each architecture.
You also need enough space in your tmp directory to allow unpacking and
compilation of the largest deps -- Boost and Qt.

Usage:
-----
When build script is envoked, it will check for the main prereqisites,
try to figure out what's missing, and prepare the compilation environment
below the 'root' directory -- the dir where the script resides (although
paths are configurable in build-* wrapper scripts).

The easies way to start compilation is by using the wrapper scripts
which have all the variables preconfigured for the most common platforms.
Here is how you can do this:

 1. Unpack LuxRender sources into the subdirectory below 'root' directory
    (where scripts are located). The subdir with Lux sources can have
    any name, however if it ends with '-opencl' then OpenCL-enabled
    version is compiled; if the name doesn't have this extension then
    Lux is compiled without OpenCL support.
    
 2. Unpack LuxRays sources into the 'luxrays' subdirectory below 'root'
    directory. These name and location are hard-coded at the moment.
    
 3. Run the wrapper script passing it the name of LuxRender sources dir
    and optionally the stage number:
    ./build-64-sse2 [stage] <lux sources>
    
    To see a list of valid stage numbers run the script without any
    parameters. Specifying a stage allows you to recompile any deps or
    to continue preparing the environment from a particular step if
    something gone wrong.
    
    If stage number is omitted it's assumed to be '5', i.e. the
    compilation will begin from LuxRays, unless the compilation
    environment is absent (the first run) -- in this case it will still
    start from the very beginning.
    
 4. Once the compilation is complete, binaries and shared libs are
    packed in tar.bz archive and saved below the platform-specific
    'target' subdirectory.
